Team - Deens Academy

Our project will address the Social Impact theme. 

How this will work-
Our websites is a way for connecting urban students to teach rural students. they can give courses on different topics, such as english or photo editing.

1. Urban students sign up for teaching children - this helps them with college credit, and just feeling good about doing something great for society. Students are now expected to give a list of free time, and courses they could take, along with the duration of each course. 
2. Most rural government schools have atleast one projector, tv and a computer. We connect with these schools, and ask them to enroll for any of the courses based on convinience and requirement. 
3. Students from 11th and 12th grade, can now teach the rural junior students about important skills, or just english through a video meeting.
