# NPSKhack-Deens

Welcome to NPSk-hack 2023! This is your official github repository. We will track your submissions via this repository. Your team can use this repository as a general version control system, but we need at least one push hourly to prevent any plagiarism. Your final submission code should be uploaded in this repository by the end of day 1 without fail.

We hope everyone has git installed in their systems. Here are some basic git bash commands you may need.

(Open the git bash in your system to use these commands)-

**git init** 

**git add .** (the '.' is used for adding all untracked/new files)

**git commit -m "<message>"**

**git branch -M main** #(to move to the main branch just incase you aren't)

**git remote add origin https://github.com/npskrmhack/NPSKhack-Deens.git**

**git push -u -f origin main** #(the -u switch makes the remote GitHub repo the default for your existing project. The -f switch forces Git to overwrite any files that already exist on GitHub with your existing projectâ€™s files)

If you have any git doubts feel free to search the same online or inform your volunteer.

All the best! Happy coding!
